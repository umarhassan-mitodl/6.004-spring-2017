## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

- [*8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism*](/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007)
- Students should feel comfortable using computers. A rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts and electrical fundamentals is assumed.

### Requirements Satisfied

- 6.004 can be applied toward a degree in {{% resource_link "a6e49a73-dfd0-4591-9acb-d040ae1cc3ce" "Electrical Science and Engineering" %}}, but is not required.
- 6.004 can be applied toward a degree in {{% resource_link "df5d4dd4-5efe-4ded-b198-f9c2cf8c73d7" "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science" %}}, but is not required.

### Offered

Every fall and spring semester

## Student Information

### Enrollment

Between 2008 and 2018, the enrollment for 6.004 rose from about 100 to 200-300 per semester.

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly sophomores, but also others, ranging from freshmen to graduate students.

### Breakdown by Major

About 4/5 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majors, 1/5 other.

### Typical Student Background

Some students came to the class with prior experience in programming and some understanding of how computers are structured; others came knowing little more than how to use a browser.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

- Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session;Â  24 sessions total.
- Class sessions were lecture-based and focused on the engineering of digital systems.

### Recitation

- Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 26 sessions total.
- Recitation groups contained 20-30 students on average and allowed students to work through practice problems and ask questions of the recitation instructors.

### Out of Class

- Outside of class, students completed seven lab assignments, worked through the online materials and practice problems in the MITx version of the course, and prepared a design project.
